Hey there! I'm **Kavin**, a BTech IT graduate with too much time and not enough common sense. During what should have been a relaxing holiday break, my brain decided that what the internet really needed was the exact opposite of a URL shortener. Because why make things more efficient when you can make them hilariously complex?

## The Dream Team

    <h3>Kavin</h3>
    <p class="role">Chief Elongation Officer (CEO)</p>
    <p>" That's me! I built this absurdity during what was supposed to be a boring holiday. Instead of catching up on sleep or touching grass, I decided to create a service that literally nobody asked for.</br> You're welcome, internet! " </p>

## Our Tech Stack (Yes, We Used Real Technology)

NotShort is built with these awesome tools:

- **Astro** - For super fast website building
- **TypeScript** - Because we like our code organized just like our long URLs
- **Supabase** - Taking care of our database, login system, and server stuff
- **UnoCSS** - Making our site look nice with simple styling tools

## Why Make URLs Longer? (Why Not?!)

Everyone's trying to make things shorter these days. URL shorteners? Boring! Everyone's doing that! But URL *lengtheners*? That's something new that nobody asked for!

Our goal is simple: take normal URLs and turn them into super long links that are fun to share and impossible to type by hand.

## How It Started 

The idea for NotShort came during a boring holiday break. Instead of doing something useful like learning new stuff or going outside, I thought the world needed something silly and fun. And so, NotShort was born â€“ made from boredom, with love.

## How We Built It

Building this site was fun, with help from:

- **AI Helpers**: GitHub Copilot (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1) and Roo Code (Gemini 2.5 Pro API)
- **Starting Template**: The "Naid" template from Astro's website, which we changed from a portfolio into our site
- **Design Idea**: "If it makes you laugh, it's good"
- **When Things Break**: "Try turning it off and on again"

## Future Plans (If People Use This)

We're using Supabase's free plan right now, which has some limits. If more people start using our site, we want to:

- Let you choose how long your URLs should be
- Make URLs with words about topics you choose
- Use AI to make even funnier URLs
- Add a paid plan to help pay for our servers

<div class="donate-banner">
  <h3>ðŸ’° Help Keep NotShort Running! ðŸ’°</h3>
  <p>So far, I've only spent my time and paid for the domain name. If you enjoy making super long URLs, please think about donating!</p>

## Link Policy

At NotShort, we handle links in a special way:

1. **One URL, One Long Link Per Account**: To save space and keep things running smoothly, each original URL can have one long version per account!

2. **Sharing Is Caring**: If you try to make a long URL for a link someone else already made, we'll show you the existing long URL instead of making a new one.

3. **Credit Where It's Due**: When you see an existing long URL, we'll show you who made it first.

4. **Why We Do This**: This approach helps us:
   - Use less database space
   - Keep links consistent
   - Stop spam
   - Keep the service free

We think this is the best way to keep our silly link service fun and working well for everyone.

## Terms of Use

When using NotShort, please:

1. **Be Nice**: Don't use our service for anything harmful, illegal, or mean.

2. **Don't Break It**: Please don't try to overload or hack our site.

3. **No Guarantees**: We try our best, but can't promise the service will always work perfectly.

4. **Have Fun**: That's what this site is for!

## FAQ
